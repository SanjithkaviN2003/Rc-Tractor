# Rc-Tractor
This Python script controls two DC motors with a Raspberry Pi using the pigpio library. It captures PWM signals for speed and direction, maps pulse widths to a 0–255 range, and adjusts motor speed and direction dynamically. Ideal for robotics, it supports forward, reverse, and turns, ensuring smooth, precise, and real-time motor control.
This Python script provides precise control for two DC motors using a Raspberry Pi and the pigpio library, making it ideal for robotics and autonomous vehicle applications. The code reads PWM signals from external sources to control motor speed and direction dynamically. The setup involves capturing pulse widths from two GPIO pins—one for speed control and the other for direction control. These pulse widths are mapped to a 0–255 range, which is used to set the duty cycle of the PWM signals driving the motors. 

The script configures the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins to interface with a motor driver, including pins for enabling the driver (STBY), controlling motor direction (AIN1, AIN2, BIN1, BIN2), and managing PWM signals for speed (PWMA and PWMB). Using callback functions, the program calculates pulse widths in microseconds and converts them to corresponding PWM values. This allows real-time adjustments in motor speed and direction, ensuring smooth and responsive operation. 

The speed control is divided into forward and reverse motions, with pulse widths above a threshold moving the motors forward and those below it reversing them. For direction control, the code adjusts motor speeds to turn left or right by varying the PWM signals for each motor, enabling differential drive. For instance, decreasing the speed of one motor relative to the other causes the robot to turn smoothly in the desired direction. 

The use of a standby (STBY) pin ensures the motor driver can be disabled for safety when not in use. The design of the code makes it flexible and efficient, supporting smooth transitions between movements and ensuring precise motor control. The modular approach allows it to be easily integrated into larger projects, such as autonomous tractors, differential-drive robots, or remote-controlled vehicles. 

This script is a robust solution for applications requiring accurate, real-time motor control using PWM signals. Its design ensures versatility, making it suitable for diverse robotics projects where responsive and efficient motor control is critical.
