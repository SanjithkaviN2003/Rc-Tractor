# Rc-Tractor
This Python script controls two DC motors with a Raspberry Pi using the **pigpio** library. It captures PWM signals for speed and direction, maps pulse widths to a 0â€“255 range, and adjusts motor speed and direction dynamically. Ideal for robotics, it supports forward, reverse, and turns, ensuring smooth, precise, and real-time motor control.
